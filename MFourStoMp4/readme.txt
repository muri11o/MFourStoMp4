...:: MFourStoMp4 ::...

Download and convert segments audio and video .m4s on .mp4.

This software was developed in Visual Studio 2022, using .NET 5.0, and written in C# language.

MFourStoMp4 makes use of FFmpeg software to perform conversion and joining of .m4s files to .mp4. Therefore, it is necessary that the "ffmpeg.exe" file is in the same directory as "MFourStoMp4.exe". (https://www.ffmpeg.org/)

How to use:
MFourStoMp4 has a very simple GUI, it consists of 4 basic steps:
1) Insert the link of the last audio segment;
2) Insert the link of the last video segment;
3) Select the folder where the .mp4 file will be saved;
4) Click on Process.

IMPORTANT: You must decor the segment number using # before and after it.
For example: example-segment-#10#.m4s
